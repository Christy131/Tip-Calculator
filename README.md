# Tip-Calculator
This was written as our first Project Assignment in class

## What the program does
Takes user input to figure the amount per person owed on bill including tax and tip

### Summary
Asks user input for how many people in party and makes sure it is a valid input
Asks user input for the amount of bill and makes sure it is a valid input
comments on the amount of the bill
calculates sales tax
Asks user input for what percent they would like to tip and makes sure it is a valid input
comments on the amount of the tip 
calculates tip
calculates the bill, tip and sale tax and splits by the number in the party
Once ran its asks the user if they would like to run it again. If Yes it runs again if no it tanks the user

#### What I learned
I learned how to outline my work, demontrated above - this was my outline. from there I built per each item (lines 4-11 above)
I learned more about defining a function and how the fuunctions work
I learned to debug, step by step where the program wasn't working and learned I needed to add a string to make the final print statement work.
I did alot of googling and video watching
